Its a simple weather app build with HTML, CSS & JS.

Inorder to work this code You need to add your own Weather API key. Inside the Weather.js file you need to pass your API key in the API URL. You can get this key from the official OpenWeatherMap site for free. Just SignUP their and verify your email, while verifying that email they give an API Key. That will put inside this API URL.

You can also use any other site API for this project. If you do so then you have to modify the JavaScript codes accordingly.
